Usage:
passgen [<pattern>]
pattern can be any space delimited combination of:
delimiter, noun, adjective, verb_base, verb_past, verb_pastparticipate, verb_ies, verb_ing
For capital letters use Noun, Adjective, Verb_base, etc.

The different verb forms are as follows:
verb_base   verb_past  verb_pastparticiple  verb_ies  verb_ing
forsake	    forsook	   forsaken	            forsakes	forsaking

Examples:

passgen 'adjective delimiter adjective delimiter noun'
passgen 'Noun delimiter Verb_ies delimiter Noun'

By using the word delimiter, passgen will chose one for you. Alternatively specify your own:

passgen 'verb_ing - adjective - noun'
